## Task 2: Calling all API

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.  
It acts like a middleman or waiter, taking requests from a customer and serving the desired data.  
In this task, I used an **API key from Weather API**.

### What I Learned
- How APIs work.  
- The role of tokens and how to modify APIs according to our needs.

## Task 3: Working with GitHub

**GitHub** is a version control platform where I can push code to a remote repository and track changes over time.  
Using **Git**, I can store code locally, update it later, and roll back changes when needed.  
GitHub also supports team collaboration by allowing multiple people to work together and merge changes safely.

### What I Learned
- Creating a Git repository locally.  
- Pushing the repository to GitHub.  
- Writing commits.  
- Updating code using version control.  
- Resolving merge conflicts.

## Task 4: Getting Familiar with Command Line Interface on Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a popular, open-source Linux operating system based on Debian.  
It is secure, user-friendly, and widely used for software development.

### Tasks Performed
- Created a folder named `testsw` using `mkdir`.  
- Created a blank file called `avengersfile` inside the folder using `touch`.  
- Created 2600 folders using the command:  
  ```bash
  mkdir $(seq -f "avengers%04g" 2 2601)
  ```  
- Concatenated two text files using the `cat` command.

## Task 5: Linear Regression from Scratch

Linear Regression helps predict missing data by learning patterns from a dataset.  
For example, it can predict future gold prices based on historical data.

### Key Concepts
- Used the **California Housing Dataset**.  
- Implemented from scratch using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-Learn**.  
- Applied the **Gradient Descent algorithm** to minimize prediction error.

### Observations
- Blue dots represent predicted values.  
- Red dots represent real values.  
- As the dataset size increases, prediction accuracy improves.

## Task 8: Writing Resource Article using Markdown

### My Learning Report on One Wing Drone

#### What I Learned
- **Aerodynamics**: Single-wing drones use stabilizers and advanced control algorithms to maintain flight stability.  
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Flight controllers process sensor data in real-time to maintain balance.  
- **Material Science**: Lightweight materials such as carbon fiber are essential.  
- **Applications & Limitations**: Used in surveillance, agriculture, and military; sensitive to payload and wind conditions.  
- **Future Potential**: AI will help make one-wing drones smarter and more autonomous.

#### Conclusion
Studying the One Wing Drone taught me how innovation can break traditional designs.  
I understood how aerodynamics, control systems, and material science combine to allow a drone to fly efficiently with only one wing.
