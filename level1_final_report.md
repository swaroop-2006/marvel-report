## Task 16: Datasheets report writing

echnical Report: L293D Motor Driver IC
1. Introduction

The L293D is a quadruple high-current half-H driver IC designed to control bidirectional drive currents of up to 600 mA per channel at voltages ranging from 4.5 V to 36 V. It is widely used in robotics and automation systems to drive inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, DC motors, and bipolar stepping motors. 
Texas Instruments

2. IC Components and Internal Structure

The L293D integrates four half-H drivers, each capable of driving a motor in both directions. Each output is a complete totem-pole drive circuit, featuring a Darlington transistor sink and a pseudo-Darlington source. This configuration allows for efficient current handling and bidirectional control. 
Texas Instruments

3. H-Bridge Configuration

The L293D utilizes an H-bridge configuration to control the direction of current flow through the motor. An H-bridge consists of four switches arranged in a bridge-like structure, enabling the polarity of the voltage applied to the load (motor) to be reversed. This allows the motor to rotate in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. 
Wikipedia

4. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for Speed Control

The L293D supports speed control through Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). By applying a PWM signal to the enable pins (1,2EN and 3,4EN), the effective voltage supplied to the motor is varied, thereby controlling its speed. A higher duty cycle increases the average voltage, resulting in higher motor speed, while a lower duty cycle decreases the speed. 
ProtoSupplies

5. Applications

Robotics: Used to drive wheels and actuators.

Automation Systems: Controls motors in conveyor belts and automated machinery.

Consumer Electronics: Drives motors in devices like fans and toys.

6. Conclusion

The L293D motor driver IC is a versatile and reliable component for controlling DC motors and stepper motors in various applications. Its integrated H-bridge configuration and support for PWM speed control make it an essential part of many electronic systems.

Technical Report: MQ135 Gas Sensor
1. Introduction

The MQ135 is a semiconductor gas sensor designed to detect a wide range of gases, including ammonia (NH₃), benzene series, alcohol, and smoke. It is widely used in air quality monitoring systems due to its sensitivity and cost-effectiveness. 
Winsen Sensors

2. Calibration for Different Gases

The sensor's resistance varies with the concentration of gases. Calibration involves determining the sensor's resistance in clean air (Ro) and at known concentrations of target gases (Rs). The ratio Rs/Ro is used to estimate the gas concentration. For example, approximate Rs/Ro values at different concentrations are:

Ammonia (NH₃):

50 ppm: Rs/Ro ≈ 3.6

100 ppm: Rs/Ro ≈ 2.2

500 ppm: Rs/Ro ≈ 0.6

Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):

50 ppm: Rs/Ro ≈ 4.0

100 ppm: Rs/Ro ≈ 2.5

500 ppm: Rs/Ro ≈ 0.7

Benzene:

50 ppm: Rs/Ro ≈ 5.0

100 ppm: Rs/Ro ≈ 3.0

500 ppm: Rs/Ro ≈ 1.0

3. Freundlich Absorption Theorem

The sensor's response to gas concentration follows the Freundlich adsorption isotherm, expressed as:

𝑥
/
𝑚
=
𝑘
𝑃
1
/
𝑛
x/m=kP
1/n

Where:

x/m: Amount of gas adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent

P: Partial pressure of the gas

k: Adsorption capacity constant

n: Empirical constant (n > 1)

This equation models the adsorption behavior of gases on the sensor's surface, aiding in understanding and predicting sensor responses. 
hub.uvcemarvel.in

4. Applications

Air Quality Monitoring: Detects pollutants in indoor and outdoor environments.

Industrial Safety: Monitors hazardous gas levels in factories.

Consumer Electronics: Integrated into devices like smart air purifiers.

5. Conclusion

The MQ135 gas sensor is a valuable tool for detecting a variety of gases. Understanding its calibration and the underlying adsorption principles enhances its application in environmental monitoring and safety systems.

## Task 19: Make a web app

I developed a simple web-based Stone-Paper-Scissor game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the user to choose between stone, paper, or scissor and plays against the computer, which makes a random choice. The result is displayed immediately, showing whether the user wins, loses, or draws. The interface is user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing, providing instant feedback. This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic implementation. It is a fun interactive project that demonstrates core web development concepts and improves user interaction skills.
